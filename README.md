## ⇁  Welcome
This is a project for me to create homebrew packages which I use for testing and deploying my applications. Keep in mind that I do not wish for this repository to be used by anyone but me, the goal is to add these simple packages to homebrew-core or other taps. The reason being is that this place is highly experimental and probably prone to breaking.

## ⇁  Contributing
If I am adding a package you are familiar with or I could do a better version of this package feel free to send in a PR.

## ⇁  Installing
To be added later
